config SH_STANDARD_BIOS
	bool "Use LinuxSH standard BIOS"
	help
	  Say Y here if your target has the gdb-sh-stub
	  package from www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS)
	  in FLASH or EPROM.  The kernel will use standard BIOS calls during
	  boot for various housekeeping tasks (including calls to read and
	  write characters to a system console, get a MAC address from an
	  on-board Ethernet interface, and shut down the hardware).  Note this
	  does not work with machines with an existing operating system in
	  mask ROM and no flash (WindowsCE machines fall in this category).
	  If unsure, say N.

config EARLY_SCIF_CONSOLE
	bool "Use early SCIF console"
	depends on CPU_SH4 || CPU_SH2A && !SH_STANDARD_BIOS

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk support"
	depends on SH_STANDARD_BIOS || EARLY_SCIF_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here to redirect kernel printk messages to the serial port
	  used by the SH-IPL bootloader, starting very early in the boot
	  process and ending when the kernel's serial console is initialised.
	  This option is only useful porting the kernel to a new machine,
	  when the kernel may crash or hang before the serial console is
	  initialised. If unsure, say N.
