	  Platforms select gpiolib if they use this infrastructure
	  for all their GPIOs, usually starting with ones integrated
	  into SOC processors.

	  Say Y here to add some extra checks and diagnostics to GPIO calls.
	  The checks help ensure that GPIOs have been properly initialized
	  before they are used and that sleeping calls aren not made from
	  nonsleeping contexts.  They can make bitbanged serial protocols
	  slower.  The diagnostics help catch the type of setup errors
	  that are most common when setting up new platforms or boards.
