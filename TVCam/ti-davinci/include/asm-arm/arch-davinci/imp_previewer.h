/************************************************************************
 * Description
 * -----------
 * Previewer device is used for accessing the image tuning capabilities
 * of the hardware. The hardware channel has many modules, each with a set
 * of parameters. The channel operates in 2 modes :-
 *   1. continuous mode. In this mode, the modules are chained in the data
 *      path from ISIF/CCDC and does image tuning on the fly. No IO
 *      allowed in this mode.
 *   2. Single shot mode. In this mode, modules are configured to tune the
 *      image stored in SDRAM. Only one IO instance allowed.
 *
 * device name : davinci_previewer
