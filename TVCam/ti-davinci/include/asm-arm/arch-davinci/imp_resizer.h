/************************************************************************
 * Description
 * -----------
 * Resizer device is used for upscale or downscale the YCbCr image to
 * desired resolution.
 * The channel operates in 2 modes :-
 *   1. continuous mode. In this mode, the resizer modules are chained in
 *      the data path from ISIF/CCDC and does resizing on the fly.
 *      No IO allowed in this mode.
 *   2. Single shot mode. In this mode, modules are configured to resize
 *      the image stored in SDRAM.  Multiple IO instances are allowed in
 *      this mode and each IO instance is allocated a logical channel.
 *
 * device name : davinci_resizer
