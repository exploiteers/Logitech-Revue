config HIGH_RES_TIMERS
	bool "High Resolution Timer Support"
	depends on GENERIC_TIME && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	help
	  This option enables high resolution timer support. If your
	  hardware is not capable then this option only increases
	  the size of the kernel image.

config NO_HZ
	bool "Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)"
	depends on HIGH_RES_TIMERS
	help
	  This option enables a tickless system: timer interrupts will
	  only trigger on an as-needed basis both when the system is
	  busy and when the system is idle.
