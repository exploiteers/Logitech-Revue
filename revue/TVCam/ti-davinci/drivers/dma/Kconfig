config DMA_ENGINE
	bool "Support for DMA engines"
	---help---
	  DMA engines offload copy operations from the CPU to dedicated
	  hardware, allowing the copies to happen asynchronously.

config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && NET
	default y
	---help---
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	  Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	  say Y here.

config DMATEST
	tristate "DMA Test client"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Simple DMA test client. Say N unless you're debugging a
	  DMA Device driver.

comment "DMA Devices"

config INTEL_IOATDMA
	tristate "Intel I/OAT DMA support"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && PCI
	default m
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) I/OAT DMA engine.

config FSL_DMA
	bool "Freescale MPC85xx/MPC83xx DMA support"
	depends on PPC
	select DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Freescale DMA engine. Now, it support
	  MPC8560/40, MPC8555, MPC8548 and MPC8641 processors.
	  The MPC8349, MPC8360 is also supported.
