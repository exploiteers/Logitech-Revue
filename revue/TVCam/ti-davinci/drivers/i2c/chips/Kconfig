	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8591 chips.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8591.

	  These devices are hard to detect and rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config ISP1301_OMAP

	depends on I2C && ARCH_OMAP_OTG
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips ISP1301
	  USB-On-The-Go transceiver working with the OMAP OTG controller.
	  The ISP1301 is used in products including H2 and H3 development
	  boards for Texas Instruments OMAP processors.
	  
	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called isp1301_omap.

# NOTE:  This isn't really OMAP-specific, except for the current
# interface location in  <include/asm-arm/arch-omap/tps65010.h>
# and having mostly OMAP-specific board support
config TPS65010
	tristate "TPS6501x Power Management chips"
	depends on I2C && ARCH_OMAP
	default y if MACH_OMAP_H2 || MACH_OMAP_H3 || MACH_OMAP_OSK
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the TPS6501x series of
	  Power Management chips.  These include voltage regulators,
	  lithium ion/polymer battery charging, and other features that
	  are often used in portable devices like cell phones and cameras.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called tps65010.

	help
	  Say yes here if you have Menelaus chip on your board

config SENSORS_M41T00
	tristate "ST M41T00 RTC chip"
	depends on I2C && PPC32
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the ST M41T00 RTC chip.

	select HAVE_GPIO_LIB
	help
	  Say Y here to enable soft power-off functionality on the Freescale
	  MPC8349E-mITX and MPC837X-RDB boards, plus this driver will register
	  MCU GPIOs as a generic GPIO API chip, so you'll able to use some MCU
	  pins as a GPIOs and LEDs.

config TI_MSP430
	tristate "MSP430 on TI Davinci"
	depends on I2C && MACH_DAVINCI_DM355_EVM
